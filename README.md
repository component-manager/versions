> Modern native Git hooks made easy

Husky2 improves your commits and more 10x 🐶 _woof!_ _woof!_ _woof!_ _woof!_ _woof!_ _woof!_ _woof!_ _woof!_ _woof!_ _woof!_

# Improvements over husky
- more simple architecture via .git-hooks.js file that sets the hooks and has all nativeBuildIn Modules already Loaded.
- much less code and documentation needed it is raw git hooks but translated to nodejs or any other compatible environment.
- faster install
